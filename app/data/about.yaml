blurb: >
  15+ years experience making websites, specializing in user-centric research, design, and development.

intro: >
    I believe a great product or service starts with really **understanding the users**. 
    This means talking to them to understand what they want (or think they want), but more
    importantly it means **observing their behavior**. At the same time, it's also critical to 
    **look at data** to understand larger patterns of behavior, and to correlate design efforts
    with the fundamental goals of the organization (usually revenue).

    ##### My passions are:
    
      - Efficient cross-discipline collaboration.      
      - Clear, functional design.      
      - Improving a humanâ€™s experience of a product or service.      
      - Seeing tangible increases in meaningful business metrics.
      - Developing and mentoring people on my team.
      - Constantly learning.

    ##### Skills

      - Interaction Design
      - Front End Development

professional: >
  Understanding your users means 
  actually talking to them, but also observing their behavior.
  Looking at the right data means you must look at metrics truly tied to revenue.
  
  **The best work gets done by including multiple disciplines** as early and as often as reality permits,
  and produces design that is clear, unobtrusive, and functional.
