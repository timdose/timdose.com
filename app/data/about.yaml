blurb: >
  I love to deeply understand customers, 
  create great experiences that speak to emotion, 
  and see meaningful business metrics go up as a result.

intro: >
    I believe a great product or service starts with deeply **understanding the customers**. 
    This means talking to them to understand what they want (or think they want), but more
    importantly it means **observing their behavior** and **understanding their emotions**. 
    At the same time, it's also critical to **look at data** to understand larger patterns of 
    behavior, and to correlate design efforts with the fundamental goals of the organization (usually revenue).

    ### My passions are:
    
      - Clear, functional design that addresses and creates emotion
      - Talking to customers and watching them use our product
      - Working closely with awesome people in lots of different fields
      - Seeing meaningful business metrics go up as a result of our work
      - Constantly learning

    ### Skills

      - User research
      - Content strategy 
      - Project management

professional: >
  Understanding your users means 
  actually talking to them, but also observing their behavior.
  Looking at the right data means you must look at metrics truly tied to revenue.
  
  **The best work gets done by including multiple disciplines** as early and as often as reality permits,
  and produces design that is clear, functional, and emotional.
