    Partnered with a top US bank to provide a game-changing loan experience for small businesses.
  problem: >
    - Getting a loan from the bank was painful and time consuming.

  process: >
    - Worked with Product and Business Development to clarify requirements. 

    - Created a low fidelity, responsive prototype.

    - Multiple cycles of user testing and iteration on prototype, with small business owners as test participants.

    - After approval from the bank, Engineering started work on major functionality.

    - In the meantime, collaborated with a visual designer to finalize look  and feel.

    - Re-tested the final designs with small business owners.

    - Front end coding and back-end loan pipeline was completed.


  results: >
    - Went live at the beginning of April with a pilot launch.

    - As of April 22, already generated 9 loans for over $350,000 in revenue.

    - One customer completed loan checkout in 10 minutes on their phone. Unheard of for the loan industry!

    Dashboard for hedge funds to monitor performance of loans purchased from OnDeck.

  problem: >
    OnDeck was only providing its high profile investors with Excel spreadsheets sent via email.

  process: >

    - Reviewed initial assumptions and requirements. 

    - Collaborative task analysis with Product and business stakeholders to uncover and prioritize features.

    - Refined requirements by interviewing portfolio managers and data analysts at the hedge funds.

    - Developed MVP prototype through user testing with customers and negotiation with Dev.

    - Started visual design, but project was put on hold before completion.


  results: >
    - Project was put on hold when a game-changing opportunity came through for OnDeck.

  description: >
    After Yodle.com's relaunch, I took over interaction design and general user experience for Yodle.com, Yodle's primary corporate site.
  problem: >
    - Attempts to increase conversion were failing.

    - Yodle.com's users were very poorly understood.

    - Very few mechanisms were in place to get insight into user sentiment and behavior.
  results: >
    - **Recordings of user sessions** hint at comprehension problems: **users seemed to be getting lost**.

    - **Remote user tests confirm comprehension problems** and reveal that **previous calls to action on site were unclear** and only speaking to certain types of visitors.

    - **A/B tests** with clearer calls to action result in a **30% increase in conversion** on Yodle.com.

  description: >
    I led the front end development for Yodle.com's recent redesign.
  problem: >
    - Previous iteration of Yodle.com was built on an obscure and overly complex PHP CMS. This resulted in long dev times and obscenely long page load times.

    - There was no version control. Could only roll back changes with support from IT, and sometimes backups hadn't happened at the right times leading to losses.

    - Coding was done directly on the production server&mdash;no deployment process.

    - No testing; bug fixes occasionally broke existing functionality, which sometimes wouldn't be discovered for weeks.
  results: >
    - Development of new site complete in 3 weeks (back on schedule after earlier phases ran late).

    - Page load times improved 50-100%.

    - Code stored in Git and deployed to staging site via post-receive hook in Git server. Deployment to production via Jenkins.

    - Pre-commit hooks and pre-push hooks run automated unit and end-to-end tests to ensure major functionality is always intact.

    CMS3 is a modular microsite publisher optimized for scale, controlled customizability, and AB Testing.
  problem: >
    - Yodle needs to deliver websites to **thousands of clients**.

    - Yodle's previous website system allowed lots of customization but proved **impossible to maintain at scale**.

    - Unlimited customization also meant **no real analytics or testing**.

    - No analytics and testing meant **no real way to improve conversion**.

    - Website setup time was unnecessarily long, leading to **high setup costs**.

    - Changes in business and legal requirements resulted in several **costly manual changes to thousands of websites**.

    - Outdated design and cumbersome response time meant **low Customer Satisfaction**.

  results: >
    - **A highly scalable system** that allows limited customization and the **ability to roll out changes at scale**.

    - **Mass modifications to thousands of sites** have been quickly and easily rolled out on several occasions.

    - Currently **powering over 12,000 client websites**.

    - **Setup time improved over 60%**.

    - **Client Satisfaction up 17%** due to improved design, onboarding process, and speed of changes.

    - A/B testing has resulted in **7% increase in aggregated conversion**; more tests underway.

  problem: >
    - Yodle gets new clients almost exclusively through long sales demos, leading to a high acquisition cost.

    - Previous attempts at Self-Signup had been costly to develop and resulted in overly-complex user experiences.
  progress: >
    - Pioneered Lean UX processes to more efficiently discover correct direction before committing dev resources.

    thumbnail: thumbnail.jpg
  description: >
    Goal: improve Client Satisfaction and Retention even further than the original designs.
  problem: >
    - Concerns about conversion created a requirement that the design and information architecture of CMS3 sites
      mirror that of Yodle's previous CMS.

    - However, these designs proved too inflexible to handle new modules and content.

    - Eventually, a study at Yodle showed that Website Conversion didn't correlate with Client Retention,
      freeing CMS3 to now focus primarily on Client Satisfaction.

  progress: >
    - New prototype designs are proving much more flexible and garnering praise from user tests.
