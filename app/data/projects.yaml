    Partnered with a top US bank to provide a game-changing loan experience for small businesses.
  opportunity: >
    - Getting a loan from the bank was painful and time consuming.

    - Since the bank already had the necessary info to make a credit decision, customers can be approved ahead of time.

    - Approved customers can simply select the amount and term they want, confirm their info, and agree to the terms. No lengthy application.

    - The bank can provide a best-in-class experience at much better rates than OnDeck can usually provide.

    - OnDeck gets access to a large, stable base of customers in low-risk situation.

  process: >
    - Worked with Product and Business Development to clarify requirements. 

    - Created a low fidelity, responsive prototype.

    - Multiple cycles of user testing and iteration on prototype, with small business owners as test participants.

    - After approval from the bank, Engineering started work on major functionality.

    - In the meantime, collaborated with a visual designer to finalize look  and feel.

    - Re-tested the final designs with small business owners.

    - Front end coding and back-end loan pipeline was completed.


  results: >
    - Went live at the beginning of April with a pilot launch.

    - As of April 22, already generated 9 loans for over $350,000 in revenue.

    - One customer completed loan checkout in 10 minutes on their phone. Unheard of for the loan industry!

    Dashboard for hedge funds to monitor performance of loans purchased from OnDeck.

  opportunity: >
    - OnDeck was only providing its high profile investors with Excel spreadsheets sent via email.

    - The portal would dramatically improve their experience.

    - The portal could also be used as a selling tool for future partners.

  process: >

    - Reviewed initial assumptions and requirements. 

    - Collaborative task analysis with Product and business stakeholders to uncover and prioritize features.

    - Refined requirements by interviewing portfolio managers and data analysts at the hedge funds.

    - Developed MVP prototype through user testing with customers and negotiation with Dev.

    - Started visual design, but project was put on hold before completion.


  results: >
    - Project was put on hold when a game-changing opportunity came through for OnDeck.

    - Yodle's process to set up microsites for their customers was very time consuming and error prone.
    
  process: >
    - Documented current state with process flow.

    - Interviewed and observed Customer Service reps setting up microsites.

    - Documented most common customer requests during site setup.
      - Vast majority were very limited: colors, basic look and feel, contact info, adding logo.

    - Created wireframes based on initial research.

    - Iterated wireframes using a prototype tested with Customer Service reps.

    - Visual design & launch.

  results: >
    - 60% improvement in setup time.

  description: >
    During the larger onboarding process with Yodle, customers use this tool to set up the basic look and feel of their microsite.
  opportunity: >
    - Customers were often surprised by the initial state of their microsite.

    - Most customers were only upset about a few things with their site—colors not matching their logo, and the general look and feel.

    - Hypothesis: giving customers input into these few items would solve the dissatisfaction, as well as give more of a sense of ownership over their site.

  process: >
    - Documented current state in a process flow.

    - Created initial wireframes and process flow, then discussed with Dev and Product.

    - Guerilla testing with local small business owners and a paper prototype.

    - Back and forth with Dev and Product to find a solution that would make a difference but still fit within the small dev allocation.

    - Compromise solution reusing existing components using Yodle’s component library.

  results: >
    - Increased customer satisfaction and fewer complaints involving their initial microsite.

  problem: >
    - Attempts to increase conversion were failing.

    - Yodle.com's users were very poorly understood.

    - Very few mechanisms were in place to get insight into user sentiment and behavior.
  results: >
    - **Recordings of user sessions** hint at comprehension problems: **users seemed to be getting lost**.

    - **Remote user tests confirm comprehension problems** and reveal that **previous calls to action on site were unclear** and only speaking to certain types of visitors.

    - **A/B tests** with clearer calls to action result in a **30% increase in conversion** on Yodle.com.

  description: >
    I led the front end development for Yodle.com's recent redesign.
  problem: >
    - Previous iteration of Yodle.com was built on an obscure and overly complex PHP CMS. This resulted in long dev times and obscenely long page load times.

    - There was no version control. Could only roll back changes with support from IT, and sometimes backups hadn't happened at the right times leading to losses.

    - Coding was done directly on the production server&mdash;no deployment process.

    - No testing; bug fixes occasionally broke existing functionality, which sometimes wouldn't be discovered for weeks.
  results: >
    - Development of new site complete in 3 weeks (back on schedule after earlier phases ran late).

    - Page load times improved 50-100%.

    - Code stored in Git and deployed to staging site via post-receive hook in Git server. Deployment to production via Jenkins.

    - Pre-commit hooks and pre-push hooks run automated unit and end-to-end tests to ensure major functionality is always intact.

    - Yodle's previous website system allowed lots of customization but proved **impossible to maintain at scale**.

    - Unlimited customization also meant **no real analytics or testing**.

    - No analytics and testing meant **no real way to improve conversion**.

    - Website setup time was unnecessarily long, leading to **high setup costs**.

    - Changes in business and legal requirements resulted in several **costly manual changes to thousands of websites**.

    Goal: improve Client Satisfaction and Retention even further than the original designs.

    - Concerns about conversion created a requirement that the design and information architecture of CMS3 sites
      mirror that of Yodle's previous CMS.

    - However, these designs proved too inflexible to handle new modules and content.

    - Eventually, a study at Yodle showed that Website Conversion didn't correlate with Client Retention,
      freeing CMS3 to now focus primarily on Client Satisfaction.
