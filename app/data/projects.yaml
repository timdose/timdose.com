    CMS3 is a modular microsite publisher optimized for scale, controlled customizability, and AB Testing.
  problem:
    - Yodle needs to deliver websites to thousands of clients.
    - Website setup was time consuming.
    - All website design changes required a ticket to web dev.
    - Inconsistent template code before and after design customizations made analytics and testing a difficult manual process.
    - Shifting legal and business requirements were costly to implement across all clientsâ€”also due to inconsistent template code.
    - Yodle's client sites appeared to not be converting well, but the lack of analytics made it difficult to prove or fix.
    - The design of many templates were outdated and difficult to modify to meet customer demands, leading to lower client Satisfaction.
  results:
    - A highly scalable system that powers over 10,000 small business websites.
    - Initial website setup time is almost 200% faster.
    - Client Services is able to make most design changes themselves, and more quickly than writing a ticket.
    - A consistent codebase and queryable design states allow far more accurate analytics, and testing is infinitely easier.
    - New legal and business requirements can be accomodated with a simple mass republish.
    - A/B testing to improve website conversion is underway.
    - Client Satisfaction up 17%, with better-looking and more stable designs.

    A new and improved Yodle.com, which was launched on May 7th, 2014.
  problem:
    - Yodle's website was built on an obscure, outdated, and expensive PHP CMS (ExpressionEngine).
    - Sales complained that the site was often slow, affecting their sales process.
    - The site was modified by editing files directly on the production server with no version control and minimal backup, prone to error and occasionally left parts of the site in a bad state visible to end users.
    - No source control meant only one person could make changes at a time.
    - There was no testing in place for the site, so fixes to one area occasionally caused problems in others, often undiscovered for long periods.
  results:
    - New site is powered by well-known, modern, and open source technologies with active communities (NodeJS and ExpressJS).
    - The new site is 200% faster than the old site, and has room for further optimization.
    - The new site is developed on local machines and stored in a Git repository, allowing sane collaboration.
    - The new site is deployed to a staging server automatically when pushing to the Git server. Code is deployed from staging to production via Jenkins. 
    - A lightweight test suite checks the major functionality of the site on each commit and push, making it very difficult to push broken functionality to production.
    - The new site was coded in 4 weeks, getting the project back on schedule after late delivery of the design.

  description: >
    A proposal for new designs for CMS3 sites, based on user research.
  problem:
    - Yodle's CMS3 launched with templates that were based on successful designs from the previous CMS. As such, they were getting a bit outdated.
    - Several new pieces of content and functionality being added to the sites were pushing the design to its limits.
  results:
    - Nicer and more modern designs, refined by actual user feedback.
    - A more modular design system to allow easy addition of new functionality and content at later dates.

screenshotTool:
  title: Yodle UX Screenshot Tool
  roles:
    - Lead Front End Developer
  description: >
    A command line tool to take screenshots of various Yodle properties with real or curated client data.
  problem:
    - UX Designers and UX management at Yodle weren't able to easily view the experiences they'd designed with real clients in realistic states.
    - As a result, there was no real way to proactively find design problems, and instead would be found and reported by clients.
  results:
    - The UX team is able to easily create screenshots of a property on demand and view them on a shared drive.
    - The UX team is able to spot issues much more quickly and address them before clients see.
