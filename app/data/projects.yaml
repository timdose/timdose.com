  blurb: Raised Client Satisfaction 17%.
  description: >
    CMS3 is a modular microsite publisher optimized for scale, controlled customizability, and AB Testing.
  problem:
    - Yodle needs to deliver websites to thousands of clients.
    - Yodle's previous website system allowed unlimited customization but proved impossible to maintain at scale.
    - Unlimited customization also prevented any real analytics or testing.
    - Need to provide limited, controlled customization but retain maintainability.
    - Need to balance sometimes conflicting metrics of Client Satisfaction and Website Conversion.
    - Provide customizable websites to improve Client Satisfaction metric.
    - At the same time, provide aggregated analytics and the ability to conduct tests to increase conversion.
  results:
    - A highly scalable system that allows limited customization and the ability to roll out changes at scale.
    - Client Satisfaction up 17%.
    - A/B testing to improve Website Conversion is underway.
