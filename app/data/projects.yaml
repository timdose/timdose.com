  roles:
    - Lead Interaction Designer
  description: >
    After Yodle.com's relaunch, I took over interaction design and general user experience for Yodle.com, Yodle's primary corporate site.
  problem: >
    - Attempts to increase conversion were failing.

    - Yodle.com's users were very poorly understood.

    - Very few mechanisms were in place to get insight into user sentiment and behavior.
  results: >
    - **Recordings of user sessions** hint at comprehension problems: **users seemed to be getting lost**.

    - **Remote user tests confirm comprehension problems** and reveal that **previous calls to action on site were unclear** and only speaking to certain types of visitors.

    - **A/B tests** with clearer calls to action result in a **30% increase in conversion** on Yodle.com.

  roles:
    - Lead Front End Developer
  description: >
    Yodle.com's redesign launched on May 7th. I was asked to lead the Front End Development.
  problem: >
    - Previous iteration of Yodle.com was built on an obscure and overly complex PHP CMS. This resulted in long dev times and obscenely long page load times.

    - There was no version control. Could only roll back changes with support from IT, and sometimes backups hadn't happened at the right times leading to losses.

    - Coding was done directly on the production server&mdash;no deployment process.

    - No testing; bug fixes occasionally broke existing functionality, which sometimes wouldn't be discovered for weeks.
  results: >
    - Development of new site complete in 3 weeks (back on schedule after earlier phases ran late).
    - Code stored in Git and deployed to staging site via post-receive hook in Git server. Deployment to production via Jenkins.
    - Pre-commit hooks and pre-push hooks run automated unit and end-to-end tests

  blurb: Raised Client Satisfaction 17%.
  thumbnail: thumbnail.jpg
  description: >
    CMS3 is a modular microsite publisher optimized for scale, controlled customizability, and AB Testing.
  problem: >
    - Yodle needs to deliver websites to thousands of clients.

    - Yodle's previous website system allowed unlimited customization but proved impossible to maintain at scale.

    - Setup time for websites was unnecessarily long, leading to increased setup costs.

    - Changes in business and legal requirements resulted in several costly manual changes to thousands of websites.

    - Unlimited customization also prevented any real analytics or testing.

    - Need to provide limited, controlled customization but retain maintainability.

    - Need to balance often-conflicting metrics of Client Satisfaction and Website Conversion.

    - Provide customizable websites to improve Client Satisfaction metric.

    - At the same time, provide aggregated analytics and the ability to conduct tests to increase conversion.
  results: >
    - A highly scalable system that allows limited customization and the ability to roll out changes at scale.

    - Currently powering over 12,000 client websites.

    - Mass modifications have been easily rolled to thousands of sites.

    - Setup time improved over 60%.

    - Client Satisfaction up 17% due to improved design and onboarding process.

    - A/B testing has resulted in 7% increase in aggregated conversion.
